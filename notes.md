issue nimislides:
- had to use import conversions instead of import ./[conversions]

## fixing stuff after dry run at "assaggi di pycon""

- [x] title

improve intro slides (write script and time it faster (5min?))
- [ ] me (add a few lines, improve speaker notes)
- [x] animate the 3 properties slide
- [ ] script and time it

improve conclusion:
- [ ] new conclusion slide

### from issue

given yesterday's dry run:
- overall structure and content is fine
- need to practice more and refine first intro part to go quicker and say fewer things
  - me slide: python clicked for me right away, had to program other stuff, when I came back to it I was happy
    - add reference here to programming language underdog 
  - nim clicked me with me right away, surprised in how I could love another language in a similar way on how I love pyton
  - working with nim improved me as pythonista, surprised on which ways I was improved
  - struggle APE: do E first, then P, then A last and explain more clearly
- redo the conclusion making more clear what are the goals: 1) taking an offside trip (like I did) is fine and might improve you in expected ways; 2) nim is a very interesting place to take an offside trip, based on some conditions and decisions about yourself and what you want to do.
- maybe add a slide about making slides with code?

other practical improvements:
- [x] title slide: contrast of colors
- [x] autoanimation for the "therapy slides" (starting with initials)
- a gif for therapy slide?
- [x] autoanimation for the hello slide
- [x] change magic to superpowers (metaprogramming is a superpower)
  - [x] also in that slide, compiles natively (not: to C)
- what do I do with the references? 
- [x] on compiler section emphasis is on safety, not expressivity
- [x] add emojis üéÑüë®‚Äçüíª to advent of code slide
- improve the color slide (more references, maybe fragments?)

## outstanding issues

- I have a CORS problem for plant app from pietroppeter to nimib-land! (reveal.js iframe issue)
  - fixed with a hack (copied and pasted html of plant_app in local)

## Thu/Fri May 2/3

    - min [x]
  - min intro ok [x]
- node 1: nim for pythonistas
  - performance [x]
  - syntax [x]
  - name overload? (link to New York RCer)

    - min [x] 
  - interop with Python [x]
  - min one ok
- node 2: compiler and types
  - compile time vs runtime

- node 3: javascript backend
  - multiple backends and FFI
    - min [x]
  - mind blown (p5nim okazzu art)

  - what is a niche tech
  - zen of python
  - zen of nim
  (- the color of a language)
  - my own open source project
  - nimib
  - nimib.py (advent of code example)
- conclusions
  - (not for now) quote by thopper on programming languages are nice (or not?)
  - not a conclusion, questions [x]
  - finish with most important idea of Python [x]
    - community work is very important
  - min ok [x]

slides nice to have:
- improve how quotes are shown
- custom background color in minSlides
- better animation for the APE slides

other slides:
- quote by Guido (use in conclusion)
  - I believe the most important idea is that Python is developed on the Internet, entirely in the open, by a community of volunteers (but not amateurs!) who feel passion and ownership.
  - ‚ÄúPython is an experiment in how much freedom programmers need. Too much freedom and nobody can read another‚Äôs code; too little and expressiveness is endangered.‚Äù
- where is Nim used? exercism, status, ...
- lignaggio (Wirthiano?)
