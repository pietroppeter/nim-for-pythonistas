# nim-for-pythonistas

me introducing [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) to pythonistas. a talk on the Nim programming language, being a Pythonista and improving your programming skills learning a (niche) language.

A lot of thoughts and work for this presentation prepared during a batch at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) üêô

## FOSDEM 2025

https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6414-nim-for-pythonistas-and-open-source-lovers-/

**Description**:

You might have heard of Nim as a fast and statically typed language with a Python-like syntax that compiles to compact executables and you are curious to hear more about it. Or you might have never heard of Nim and you might be curious what a talk about another programming language (that is not Rust) has anything to do with a Python devroom. Or maybe you are someone who loves Open Source (possibly even contributed to some open source projects) but does not feel like you will ever be able to contribute a project of your own that might interest others. If you connect with one of these three descriptions, I have prepared this talk for you. Even if you do not see yourself in any of those, please keep reading to see if you should consider joining the Python devroom for this talk.

This talk is divided in three parts:

1. What is Nim?
2. Why Nim made me a better Pythonista
3. How Nim can help you getting more involved in Open Source

In the first part I will give a quick introduction to Nim emphasizing similarity and differences with Python. I will explain that Nim can be used as a fast and easy to learn complement to Python with a great interoperability and metaprogramming superpowers. Nim has also a powerful type system, functional features and can compile to Javascript.

In the second part I will tell you a bit about my story on how I got attracted to Nim coming from Python, the benefits of a niche community, and how I came out with a deeper appreciation for the Python project and community.

In the third part, I will show you how easy it is to create your own open source project with Nim and share it with the world (maybe even a Python version of it), and I will tell you a little bit about my own open source project, called Nimib, a literate programming tool for interactive explanations.

The talk is kept approachable for beginners while trying to be interesting also for experts. It does not have any specific pre-requisites on Nim, Python or Open Source but a familiarity and interest with at least one of those will help you take the most out of it.

**Elevator Pitch**: What if I could tell you that there is a language that looks like Python but achieves the performance of C? And that also has the power of metaprogramming of Lisp? Nim is a statically typed compiled language that does all the above and more. And it is easy to learn for Pythonistas.

**Description**:

Experienced Pythonistas are used to reach out to an alternative language when in need for higher performance. In the past this meant to reach out for C, C++ or Cython, more recently the trend is towards Rust. Nim is a relatively unexplored option as a language to learn as a second (or third or ‚Ä¶) language on top of Python, but it does provide some interesting benefits.
As Rust, Nim is a statically typed and compiled programming language that can be use to boost Python‚Äôs performance. But Nim has different tradeoffs, in particular less emphasis on memory safety and a much easier learning curve, thanks to a indentation based syntax very much familiar to Python developers. 

In this talk we will give a brief presentation of Nim language particularly tailored to Pythonistas. We will cover the language from the ground up, making frequent remarks to the differences with Python. We will briefly cover metaprogramming, one of the most powerful parts of Nim. We will try to cover the philosophy of the language (the Zen of Nim) and we will also cover the part of the ecosystem that are relevant for interoperability with Python (nimpy, nimporter, ‚Ä¶).
We will also cover one of the most interesting aspects of Nim that represents a rather distinctive selling point: Nim can compile to Javascript and allows us to be able to work with frontend technologies directly.

At the end we will briefly cover Nimib, my open source project recently ported also to Python. This will showcase a way to use metaprogramming in a real project and how to create a Python package using Nim.

The goal of this talk is to make you curious to go and try out Nim (come for the performance, stay for the ergonomics!), but even if you just come out with a better appreciation and understanding of Python we would still be happy.

## Lightning at PyCon Sweden 2023

Lightning talk 5' at PyCon Sweden 2023, November 10th. That lightning session was lots of fun, watch it in full here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLCTCyTjqFc

## code for slides

slides are done with [nimislides] (a [nimib] theme). slide code is structure in modules (using named templated for slide), it is a helpful way to structure nimislides code while working on it.
